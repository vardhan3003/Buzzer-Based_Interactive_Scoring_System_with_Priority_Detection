Buzzer-Based Interactive Scoring System with Precision Timing

This project is an advanced scoring system designed for competitive environments, where timing accuracy is critical. It employs high-precision timing mechanisms capable of detecting and processing input differences in the millisecond, microsecond, and even nanosecond range, ensuring fair and reliable performance.

Key Features:

Precision Input Detection: The system captures button press timings with exceptional granularity, enabling it to differentiate inputs arriving just nanoseconds apart.
Real-Time Scoring Updates: Scores for multiple teams are dynamically updated and displayed on a 7-segment display for instant visibility.
Interactive Feedback: LEDs and a buzzer provide clear visual and auditory cues, indicating the winning team or successful score updates.
Debounce Logic: Integrated mechanisms eliminate noise and spurious signals, ensuring only valid button presses are registered.
Versatile Functionality: The system allows for both incrementing and decrementing scores, making it adaptable to various scoring needs.

This project showcases expertise in high-speed digital design, precise signal processing, and real-time interaction, making it ideal for time-sensitive applications in competitive settings.
